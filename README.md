# Getting Started

This is a modification of 
the [Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) application. I have added a widget library and lazy-loading in order to demonstrate bundle optimization. Please see the commit history, which serves as a succession of demo steps.

## Presentation

This example was created for the May 2020 [Advanced Angular Lunch presentation.](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Lunch/events/270604253/)
